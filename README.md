# Birthday
Simple program that I made in python to verify if there is a birthday close.
To personalize it you just need to call the function "verficarAnivers√°rio" and put the name
and the date of the person's birthday.
If you want it to verify everday you can simply put the program on your inicialization folder so it will
inicializate every time you turn your PC on.
